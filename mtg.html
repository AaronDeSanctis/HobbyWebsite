					<h3>Magic The Gathering</h3>
					<p>I started playing Magic when I was 11 years old with my best friend. We were awful at the game. Playing cards that are worth less than a penny, but somehow we still managed to have evenly matched decks for years to come. I didn't really start getting good at magic till I quit the game for about 4 years. I came back to it at a level that I didn't think I was capable of. I started winning local tournemants and have had continued success at the game for some time now. There are multiple formats of magic. All of which are interesting and vastly different but I prefer to play a format called limited. It's a game where you have a very shallow card pool but make the best out of what you are given. I have had most of my victories from limited. I would say my greatest strength as a player is that I'm exceedingly cautious and efficient.</p>
